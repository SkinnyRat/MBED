Applications for the ARM mbed NXP LPC1768 microcontroller. 

[1] The fan-timer controller - used to programatically turn on & off a USB fan at specified intervals. 
Requires 2 separate power sources as 1 USB power bank alone cannot supply enough electricity for both the fan and the LCD.

[2] The temperature logger - used to passively record the surrounding temperature on an SD-card. 
Due to space & electricity constraints the LCD & SD-card reader are not used on the same board at the same time.
